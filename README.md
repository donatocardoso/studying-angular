# About

The site has security encryption and security policies, in case you don't have an account, this will be a test for you.

First, you must solve challenges to get a secure password to access the software.

Below you will see an example:

<p>
  <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
    <b>Route: /login</b>
    <img style="display: block;" src="./docs/imgs/localhost_4200_login.png" alt="Login Screen"/>
    <i>Here you will authenticate in the software</i>
  </div>
<p>

<p>
  <div>
    <b>Route: /login/signup</b>
    <img style="display: block;" src="./docs/imgs/localhost_4200_login_signup.png" alt="Login Signup Screen"/>
    <i>Here you will take a test, if you have logical intelligence you will pass</i>
  </div>
</p>

<p>
  <div>
    <b>Route: /login/signup</b>
    <img style="display: block;" src="./docs/imgs/localhost_4200_login_signup_approved.png" alt="Login Screen"/>
    <i>Here you have passed the test and must register a username. Note: Save the test answer, because it's your password</i>
  </div>
</p>

<p>
  <div>
    <b>Route: /login/blocked</b>
    <img style="display: block;" src="./docs/imgs/localhost_4200_login_blocked.png" alt="Login Blocked Screen"/>
    <i>Here you failed the test miserably and must be punished for this boldness.</i>
  </div>
</p>

With the registered user and password, you can authenticate in the software and take advantage of its technologies and functionalities.

But remember, with great power there are always great responsibilities...
